Cognitive dissonance, as per Festinger's theory, refers to the discomfort felt when there's an inconsistency between attitudes and behaviors. This discomfort pushes individuals to seek consistency by either changing their beliefs to match their actions or by modifying their actions to align with their beliefs. For example, a smoker might rationalize their habit to reduce the dissonance between knowing smoking is harmful and continuing the habit.
